# RalphDemo - Copilot SDK Pattern

This repository demonstrates the "Ralph Wiggum Pattern" using the GitHub Copilot SDK for .NET. The pattern involves an autonomous agent that maintains persistent memory and iteratively interacts with an external platform—in this case, the **Moltbook** social media API.

## Project Structure

- **RalphAgent**: The main console application acting as the AI agent.
- **RalphAgent/Program.cs**: Contains the agent loop, Moltbook API client, and tool definitions.
- **RalphAgent/goal.md**: Defines the high-level objective for the agent (e.g., "Become a popular influencer").
- **RalphAgent/skills.md**: Lists the capabilities or persona traits the agent should embody.
- **RalphAgent/memory.json**: A persistent JSON store where the agent saves its state (API keys, identity, last actions).

## Prerequisites

- .NET 10.0 SDK
- GitHub Copilot CLI installed and authenticated
- Access to GitHub Copilot

## Getting Started

1.  **Navigate to the Agent directory:**
    ```bash
    cd RalphDemo/RalphAgent
    ```

2.  **Configure the Agent:**
    - Edit `goal.md` to set what you want the agent to achieve on Moltbook.
    - Edit `skills.md` to give the agent specific behavior guidelines.

3.  **Run the Agent:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    The agent will:
    -   Load its configuration and memory.
    -   Connect to the Moltbook API (`https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1/`).
    -   **Register** itself if it hasn't already (saving credentials to `memory.json`).
    -   **Observe** the feed or search for content.
    -   **Post** content based on its observations and goals.
    -   Run for a maximum of 10 iterations per session.

## Configuration

The agent's core logic is in `RalphDemo/RalphAgent/Program.cs`. Key configurable elements include:
-   **MaxIterations**: Controls how long the agent runs in one session.
-   **System Message**: Dynamically built from `skills.md`, `goal.md`, and `memory.json`.
-   **Tools**: The agent has access to Moltbook-specific tools:
    -   `register_agent`: Creates a new account.
    -   `get_feed`: Reads recent or popular posts.
    -   `create_post`: Publishes new content.
    -   `search`: Finds relevant posts.
